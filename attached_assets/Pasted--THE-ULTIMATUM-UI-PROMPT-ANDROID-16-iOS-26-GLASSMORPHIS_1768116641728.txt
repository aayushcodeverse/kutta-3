🧊✨ THE ULTIMATUM UI PROMPT
(ANDROID 16 × iOS 26 × GLASSMORPHISM)
🔥 COPY–PASTE THIS EXACTLY INTO REPLIT AI

You are an elite futuristic UI/UX engineer designing interfaces for Android 16, iOS 26, Apple Vision Pro, and next-gen Pixel devices.
Redesign ONLY the FRONTEND UI of my existing Flask-based school election system.
The backend logic already exists and MUST NOT be changed.
The UI must use GLASSMORPHISM and feel like a 2026+ system UI.
This is NOT a website — it must feel like a native next-gen OS experience.

🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE UI PHILOSOPHY

Glass > solid colors

Blur > flat backgrounds

Depth > flat cards

Motion > static screens

Soft light > harsh contrast

If it looks like:

a form ❌

a dashboard ❌

a website ❌

IT IS WRONG.

🧊 CORE DESIGN REFERENCES (MANDATORY)

Blend these EXACTLY:

iOS 26 Glass UI (VisionOS style)

Frosted glass panels

Background blur

Floating layers

Soft light reflections

Android 16 / Material You NEXT

Dynamic surfaces

Rounded containers

Fluid motion

Depth-based elevation

Nothing OS / Pixel UI

Calm

Minimal

Confident

Touch-first

❌ NO Bootstrap
❌ NO old Material
❌ NO sharp edges

🏫 BRANDING (FUTURISTIC, NOT SCHOOLY)

School logo:

Circular

Glass background

Subtle glow

App name:
School Election System

Subtitle:
Secure • Paperless • Transparent

Color palette:

Glass white

Soft blur grey

Neon eco-green accents

iOS-style blue highlights

⏳ SPLASH / BOOT SCREEN (OS-LEVEL FEEL)

Reference: Apple Vision Pro boot

Design:

Fullscreen blurred gradient background

Floating glass card in center

School logo inside glass

Text:
Digital School Election

Subtle shimmer / glow

Smooth zoom-in transition

This should feel like booting an OS, not loading a site.

🗳️ VOTING UI — GLASS PANELS
🧊 Voting Container

Center floating glass panel

Background blurred (backdrop-filter)

Rounded corners (24–32px)

Soft shadow

Slight transparency

🧑‍🎓 Candidate Cards (THIS IS THE HEART)

Design candidate cards like floating glass tiles:

Frosted glass background

Blur level: medium

Soft border glow

Large rounded corners

Candidate photo inside circular glass frame

Name below, clean typography

Selection animation:

Glass brightens

Border glow intensifies

Subtle haptic-style scale (CSS)

NOTA = same glass card. No special ugly button.

Layout:

2 cards per row

Plenty of breathing space

Zero clutter

🧭 PROGRESS INDICATOR (FUTURE STYLE)

Thin glowing progress bar

Floating above panel

Text:
Post 3 of 5

Smooth animated fill

Feels like iOS system indicator.

✅ CONFIRMATION SCREEN (GLASS MODAL)

Glass modal floats above blurred background

Summary shown as glass chips

Warning text softly muted

Primary button glows subtly

🎉 SUCCESS SCREEN (VISION PRO FEEL)

Big glowing check icon

Glass background

Text:
Vote Recorded

Subtext:
Thank you for voting 🌱

Auto fade-out → reset

🧑‍🏫 ADMIN / ADD CANDIDATES (NEXT-GEN TOOL UI)

Reference:

Apple Settings glass panels

VisionOS system windows

Design:

Floating stacked glass panels

No sidebars

No tables

Cards only

Add Candidate:

Glass input fields

Floating labels

Soft focus glow

Toggle switches (iOS style)

Candidates grouped by post in glass grids.

✨ MOTION & MICRO-INTERACTIONS (CRITICAL)

Smooth ease-in-out everywhere

Fade + slight scale transitions

Hover = lift + glow

Button press = subtle shrink

NOTHING abrupt

Motion must feel alive but calm.

🌱 ECO CUE (MINIMAL)

Tiny 🌱 icon in corner

Text:
Paper-free election

NO banners. NO paragraphs.

🧱 TECH RULES (STRICT)

Flask + Jinja2

Tailwind CSS with backdrop-filter
OR custom CSS glassmorphism

No JS frameworks unless essential

Backend untouched

🏁 FINAL ABSOLUTE STANDARD

The UI should feel like:

“An unreleased Android 16 / iOS 26 system app.”

If it feels like:

a website ❌

a college project ❌

a dashboard ❌

RESTART.
