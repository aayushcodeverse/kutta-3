You are a senior UI/UX designer who has worked on Instagram, Threads, and modern consumer apps.
Redesign ONLY the FRONTEND UI of my existing Flask-based school election system.
The backend logic already exists and MUST NOT be changed.
The UI must feel like INSTAGRAM — smooth, minimal, modern, premium, and emotionally calming.
No generic admin dashboards. No boring forms.

🎯 CORE DESIGN REFERENCE (MANDATORY)

Use Instagram’s design language as the PRIMARY reference:

Clean white background

Soft shadows

Rounded cards

Smooth micro-interactions

Minimal text

Strong visual hierarchy

Calm, addictive UX

Also lightly blend:

Apple animations

Material 3 motion (subtle)

❌ Do NOT use Bootstrap
❌ Do NOT use old-school admin UI
❌ Do NOT use sharp edges or dense tables

🏫 BRANDING (INSTAGRAM-STYLE)

School logo:

Circular (like profile picture)

Top center or top-left

App name below logo:
“School Election”

Subtitle:
Paperless • Secure • Teacher Supervised

Colors:

Base: White

Text: Soft black / dark grey

Accent: Instagram-style soft blue + eco green

No loud colors

Typography:

Inter / SF Pro / Poppins

Light → Regular → SemiBold (NO heavy bolds)

⏳ SPLASH / LOADING SCREEN (INSTAGRAM APP FEEL)

Reference: Instagram app opening screen

Design:

White background

Centered circular school logo

Below logo:
School Election System

Very subtle fade-in

Thin animated progress bar or spinner

Smooth transition into app

NO loud animations.

🧭 NAVIGATION FEEL

No sidebars

No top-heavy navbars

Use:

Centered cards

Bottom subtle progress indicators (like stories)

Everything should feel touch-friendly, even on laptop

🗳️ STUDENT VOTING UI (INSTAGRAM CARD FEED STYLE)
Candidate Cards — THIS IS CRITICAL

Design candidate selection like Instagram post cards:

Rounded rectangles (16–20px radius)

Soft shadow

Candidate photo/avatar on top

Name below

Tap/click to select

Selection state:

Soft blue / green outline

Checkmark icon

NOTA styled EXACTLY like candidates

Layout:

2 cards per row

Plenty of breathing space

No scrolling if possible

Progress Indicator (Instagram Stories Style)

At top:

Thin horizontal bars

“Post 2 of 5”

Smooth animated fill

✅ CONFIRMATION & SUCCESS SCREENS (INSTAGRAM-LIKE)
Confirmation Screen

Clean summary cards

No tables

Soft warning text:
“Once submitted, votes cannot be changed.”

Success Screen

Large green check icon

Text:
“Vote submitted successfully”

Subtext:
Thank you for voting 🌱

Auto reset after 4–5 seconds

🧑‍🏫 ADMIN / ADD CANDIDATES UI (INSTAGRAM CREATOR TOOLS FEEL)

Reference:

Instagram “Create Post”

Instagram “Professional Dashboard”

Design rules:

Centered modal-style cards

Floating buttons

Clean input fields

Rounded everything

No side menus

Add Candidate:

Name

Post

Photo (optional)

Toggle: Active / Inactive

Candidates grouped by post in card grids, not tables.

✨ MICRO-INTERACTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Add:

Smooth hover lift on cards

Button press ripple

Page fade transitions

Soft easing (no snapping)

Animations must feel invisible but premium.

🌱 ECO-FRIENDLY (SUBTLE, INSTAGRAM STYLE)

No banners. No lectures.

Just:

Small 🌱 icon in footer

Text:
Paper-free election

🧱 TECH RULES

Flask + Jinja2 templates

Tailwind CSS OR custom CSS

No Bootstrap

No JS frameworks unless absolutely needed

Keep backend untouched

🏁 FINAL STANDARD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The UI should feel like:

“An Instagram-designed voting app adapted for school elections.”

If it feels like a website, it’s WRONG.
It must feel like an APP.
