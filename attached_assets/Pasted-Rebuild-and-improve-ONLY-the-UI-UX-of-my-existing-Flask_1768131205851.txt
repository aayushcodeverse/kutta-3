Rebuild and improve ONLY the UI/UX of my existing Flask-based school election system.
The backend logic, voting logic, authentication, and Google Sheets integration MUST remain completely unchanged.
This task is a strict UI/UX QUALITY UPGRADE, not a feature rewrite, not an experiment, and not a creative demo.

🎓 MAIN TITLE (MANDATORY & EXACT)

The main title at the top of the application MUST be exactly:

Little Scholars Academy
Parliament Elections 2026–27

Rules:

Two-line title

System font only (SF Pro / Inter / System UI)

Semi-bold (not heavy, not decorative)

Calm, authoritative, school-official tone

No effects, no glow, no animation on title

🔢 VOTER NUMBER RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every voter is issued a 4-digit numeric voting number ONLY

Examples: 1027, 3842

No letters

No symbols

No more or fewer than 4 digits

Display the voter number clearly in the UI using a system-style badge

The badge must look official and institutional, not decorative or flashy

🧊 GLASSMORPHISM — PROFESSIONAL STANDARD ONLY

Use restrained, OS-level glassmorphism, not flashy or exaggerated effects.

Glass rules:

Background blur: 8–14px

Opacity: 0.6 – 0.75

Border: 1px subtle white or grey

Shadow: very soft and minimal

❌ No neon glows
❌ No heavy blur
❌ No colorful gradients on cards
❌ No “wow” effects

Glass must feel:

Calm

Premium

OS-level

Serious and trustworthy (school election system)

If the glass draws attention → it is wrong.

🧱 LAYOUT & STRUCTURE (CRITICAL)

Clean, structured layouts

Proper margins and consistent spacing

Strong alignment and hierarchy

Content must feel anchored and stable

No overcrowding

Avoid “center everything” layouts

Design references:

iOS Settings

Pixel system apps

Minimal VisionOS panels

If it looks like a poster, demo, or student project → it is incorrect.

🗳️ VOTING SCREEN UI

Candidates must be displayed as:

Rectangular glass cards

Corner radius: 12–16px

Candidate image, name, and post clearly visible

No glow by default

On selection:

Subtle border highlight

Background becomes slightly more solid

Small check indicator appears

❌ No flip animations
❌ No pulsing glow
❌ No game-like or playful effects

The voting screen must feel official, neutral, and trustworthy.

🧑‍🎓 STUDENT FLOW RULES

Student registration must be completely hidden from the frontend

Students must never see registration forms or admin controls

Students authenticate ONLY using pre-generated 4-digit voter numbers

The student-facing UI must remain minimal and distraction-free

🧑‍🏫 ADMIN FLOW RULES

All election posts (positions) are added only by the admin

All candidates are added by the admin with:

Name

Post

Image

Admin UI must feel like a system control panel, not a website or dashboard

Admin UI rules:

No tables if possible

Use stacked glass panels

Clean system-style form fields

Clear labels

Minimal colors

No analytics-style dashboards

📊 LIVE RESULTS PAGE

Votes must be counted live in the backend

Results must be displayed on a separate, restricted page

Clean, professional presentation

No flashy charts or animations

Focus on clarity and legitimacy

⏳ FLOW & MOTION

Subtle transitions only (120–180ms)

Fade and minimal movement

No bounce

No dramatic motion

The app should feel:

“Quietly powerful and professional”

If animations are noticeable → reduce them.

🌱 ECO MESSAGE (SUBTLE ONLY)

Include ONLY a small line somewhere:
“Paperless Election Initiative”

Rules:

No banners

No green overload

No preaching

🎨 COLORS & TYPOGRAPHY (LOCKED)

Colors:

White / off-white backgrounds

Dark grey / near-black text

ONE accent color only (muted blue or muted green)

Typography:

Inter / SF Pro / System UI

Font weights: 400 / 500 / 600 only

No fancy fonts

No decorative headings

🧪 FINAL QUALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before finishing, verify:

This does NOT look like a student project

This looks like a real institutional election system

This could realistically be deployed in a school environment

If unsure → simplify further.

Rebuild the UI with restraint, discipline, and professional polish.
Premium = controlled, calm, and confident — never flashy.
