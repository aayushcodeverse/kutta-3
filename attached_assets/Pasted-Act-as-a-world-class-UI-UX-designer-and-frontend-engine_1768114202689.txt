Act as a world-class UI/UX designer and frontend engineer who designs interfaces comparable to Apple, Google, and modern government EVM systems.
Your task is to completely redesign the FRONTEND UI of an existing Flask-based school election system.
The backend logic already exists and MUST NOT be changed.
Focus ONLY on UI, UX, layout, animations, branding, and user experience.

🧠 DESIGN GOALS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

UI must look professional, premium, and trustworthy

Suitable for school principal & teachers

Clean, calm, authoritative — NOT flashy or childish

Inspired by:

Apple setup screens

Modern voting machines

Government portals (but beautiful)

🏫 BRANDING REQUIREMENTS

Integrate school logo prominently:

On loading screen

On header/navbar

On footer

Color palette:

Primary: Deep Green / Navy Blue (trust & eco)

Secondary: White / Light Grey

Accent: Soft Green (eco-friendly)

Typography:

Headings: Poppins / Inter / SF-like fonts

Body: Clean, readable sans-serif

⏳ LOADING / SPLASH SCREEN (IMPORTANT)

Create a professional loading screen that:

Shows school logo in center

Text below logo:

“School Election System”
“Secure • Paperless • Transparent”

Subtle animation:

Fade-in

Progress bar or spinner

Auto-transitions into main page

This screen must feel official and calm, not flashy.

🖥️ PAGE-BY-PAGE UI REQUIREMENTS
1️⃣ HOME / ENTRY PAGE

Full-screen centered card

School logo at top

Title: “Digital School Election Portal”

Subtitle: Eco-Friendly | Secure | Teacher Supervised

Single primary button:
“Proceed to Voting”

Footer text:
“This election is paper-free 🌱”

2️⃣ VOTING ID ENTRY PAGE

Minimal distraction

Large input field

Clear instruction text

Big Verify button

Error messages:

Friendly

Calm

Non-alarming

3️⃣ MULTI-POST VOTING SCREENS (MOST IMPORTANT)

Design each post screen like this:

Top progress indicator:
Post 2 of 5

Big post title (e.g., Head Boy)

Candidate cards:

Rounded

Hover highlight

Click animation

Selected state:

Green border

Check icon

NOTA styled same as candidates

“Next” button disabled until selection

NO scrolling if possible.

4️⃣ FINAL CONFIRMATION PAGE

Summary card:

Shows selected candidates per post

Warning text:
“Once submitted, votes cannot be changed.”

Two buttons:

Confirm & Submit (Primary)

Cancel (Secondary – teacher only)

5️⃣ SUCCESS SCREEN

Green check animation

Message:
“Your vote has been recorded successfully.”

Subtext:
“Thank you for contributing to a paper-free election 🌱”

Auto-reset countdown (5 seconds)

6️⃣ ADMIN / TEACHER PANEL UI

Dashboard-style layout

Cards for:

Voting Status

Total Votes

Results

Charts:

Clean bar / pie charts

Buttons:

Start Voting

Pause Voting

End Voting

Professional, not flashy

✨ MICRO-INTERACTIONS & ANIMATIONS

Add:

Button hover transitions

Smooth page transitions

Fade-in content

Subtle shadows

No over-animation

Animations must feel calm and premium.

📱 RESPONSIVENESS

Must work perfectly on:

Laptop (primary)

Tablet (optional)

No mobile-first clutter

🌱 ECO-FRIENDLY VISUAL CUES

Small leaf icons 🌱

Soft green highlights

Footer reminder:
“This election saved paper and reduced waste.”

🧱 TECH CONSTRAINTS

Use Flask templates (Jinja2)

Use pure CSS or Tailwind CSS

No backend logic changes

Keep code clean and commented

Modular CSS files preferred

🏁 FINAL EXPECTATION

The UI should make a principal think:

“This looks official, safe, and school-approved.”

And students think:

“Wow… this is serious.”

🔥 END PROMPT
