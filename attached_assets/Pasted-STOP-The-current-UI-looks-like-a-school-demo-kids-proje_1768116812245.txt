STOP.
The current UI looks like a school demo / kids project.
This is unacceptable.
You must REBUILD the UI with PROFESSIONAL INDUSTRIAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
No playful, cartoonish, exaggerated, or “cool-looking” elements are allowed.

You are now designing for:

Apple VisionOS engineers

Android System UI team

Nothing OS industrial designers

If it looks like something a student could design → DELETE IT.

❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (THIS IS WHY IT LOOKS BAD)

DO NOT USE:

Neon gradients

Oversized glow effects

Cartoon shadows

Over-rounded cards

Fancy fonts

Emoji-style icons

Loud colors

“Cool animations”

Excessive blur

Fancy hover gimmicks

These are kids-project signals.

✅ REAL NEXT-GEN OS DESIGN RULES
1️⃣ GLASSMORPHISM ≠ FLASHY

Glass must be:

Subtle

Mature

Muted

Industrial

Glass opacity: 0.55 – 0.75
Blur: 8px – 14px (NOT MORE)
Border: 1px hairline, barely visible

If the glass is “wow” → it’s wrong.
Glass should feel calm and expensive.

2️⃣ COLOR PALETTE (LOCK THIS)

Use ONLY:

#F5F5F7 (Apple system white)

#0A0A0A (deep black)

#1C1C1E (iOS dark grey)

Accent: ONE muted eco green OR system blue

NO gradients unless background-only and barely visible.

3️⃣ TYPOGRAPHY (THIS IS CRITICAL)

If fonts are wrong → whole UI looks childish.

Use ONLY:

SF Pro / Inter / System UI

Font weight: 400, 500, 600 only

NO bold headlines

NO decorative fonts

Text must look like Settings app, not a poster.

4️⃣ LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY (WHY IT FEELS CHILDISH NOW)

STOP CENTERING EVERYTHING.

Real OS UIs:

Use alignment

Use spacing

Use margins

Use hierarchy

Content should feel:

Anchored

Stable

Quiet

Confident

No floating-for-the-sake-of-floating.

🧊 CANDIDATE UI — REBUILD THIS PROPERLY

Current glowing tiles = ❌ childish.

Correct approach:

Rectangular glass cells

Slight corner radius (12–16px)

No glow by default

On select:

Border darkens

Background slightly solidifies

Tiny check indicator appears

Think:
iOS list selection, not game cards.

🧭 ANIMATIONS — CUT 70%

If users NOTICE animations → too much.

Allowed:

120–180ms ease

Opacity fade

Micro translate (2–4px)

NOT allowed:

Bounce

Scale pop

Glow pulse

Dramatic transitions

🧑‍🏫 ADMIN PANEL — THIS IS A BIG FAIL AREA

Admin must look like:

System settings

Control panel

Internal tool

NOT:

Dashboard

Website

Analytics panel

Structure:

Vertical stacked sections

Each section = glass panel

Inputs look like iOS settings fields

🟢 ECO THEME — STOP FLEXING IT

Eco ≠ green everywhere.

ONLY:

Small text line

Tiny leaf icon

One muted accent

Anything more = NGO poster vibes ❌

🧪 FINAL REALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before finishing, you MUST self-evaluate:

Ask:

Would Apple ship this?

Would Google System UI approve this?

Would this feel normal on a Pixel lock screen?

If answer is NO → redo.

🧨 HARD RESET INSTRUCTION

Delete all current UI code except base layout.
Rebuild slowly, minimal-first, system-first, boring-first.
Make it feel boringly premium.

Premium ≠ exciting
Premium = restrained.

🔥 END PROMPT
🧠 WHY THIS WILL WORK

Your previous result failed because:

AI optimized for “cool”

Not for “real product”

Not for “system UI discipline”

This prompt:

Removes creativity

Enforces restraint

Forces industrial design thinking
