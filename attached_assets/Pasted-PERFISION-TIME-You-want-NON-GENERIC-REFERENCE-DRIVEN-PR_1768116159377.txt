PERFISION TIME 🎯
You want NON-GENERIC, REFERENCE-DRIVEN, PREMIUM UI, and the ability to ADD CANDIDATES dynamically — without the AI giving you boring bootstrap forms.

Below is a REFERENCE-AWARE, UI-STRICT PROMPT that forces Replit AI to copy design language, not generic layouts.

🎨🔥 ULTIMATE UI PROMPT (WITH REFERENCES + CANDIDATE MGMT)
✅ WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Adds candidate management (admin side)

Forces a specific design reference

Prevents “generic admin panel” UI

Keeps backend intact

Produces premium election-grade UI

🔥 PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT AI (AS-IS)

You are a senior UI/UX engineer.
Redesign ONLY the FRONTEND of my existing Flask election system and add an Admin Candidate Management UI.
The backend already exists — do NOT rewrite core logic unless required to support candidate data.
Your UI must NOT look generic.

🎯 UI REFERENCE (MANDATORY — FOLLOW THIS)

Use these visual and UX references as inspiration (copy design language, spacing, typography, layout logic):

Apple Setup & iOS system screens

Centered content

Large typography

Calm spacing

Minimal buttons

Indian Government EVM UI (modernized)

High contrast

Clear choices

Serious, trustworthy feel

Google Material 3 (NOT Bootstrap)

Cards

Elevation

Motion

Rounded components

❌ DO NOT use Bootstrap-style admin dashboards
❌ DO NOT use generic sidebar layouts

🏫 BRANDING RULES

Place school logo in:

Splash screen

Top header

Colors:

Deep green / navy

White background

Typography:

Inter / Poppins / SF-like fonts

Icon style:

Material Icons / Lucide

⏳ SPLASH / LOADING SCREEN (REFERENCE: Apple Boot)

Subtitle:
Secure • Paperless • Teacher Supervised

Subtle fade + progress animation

Auto-redirect

Photo (optional)

Edit / Disable candidate

Candidates grouped by post

Drag-to-reorder (optional)

UI Rules:

Centered card

Soft borders

No sidebars

Clear typography

📄 CANDIDATE DATA MODEL (SIMPLE)

Store candidates in Google Sheets or JSON:

Post | CandidateID | Name | Active


UI must auto-load candidates dynamically.

✨ MICRO-INTERACTIONS (REFERENCE: Apple)

Card hover lift

Smooth transitions

Button press feedback

No flashy animations

Calm, premium motion

🌱 ECO VISUAL CUES (SUBTLE)

🧱 TECH CONSTRAINTS

Flask + Jinja2 templates

Tailwind CSS OR custom CSS

Modular CSS

Keep backend logic intact

🏁 FINAL UI STANDARD

The UI must look like:

“A government-approved, Apple-designed school election system.”

If it looks like a college admin panel, it is WRONG.
