Act as a senior backend engineer and system architect.
Build a secure, eco-friendly digital school election system using Flask (Python) as the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and Google Sheets as the database.
The system will be deployed on Render.
It must be simple, reliable, teacher-controlled, and suitable for school elections.

🧠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Build TWO FLASK WEB APPLICATIONS (or two modules in one Flask project):

Voter ID Generator System (Pre-Election)

Digital Voting System (Election Day)

Constraints:

Only Class 8 & 9 students are eligible

One laptop used for voting

Fully teacher supervised

Eco-friendly replacement for paper ballots

Google Sheets used as the single source of truth

🧩 APP 1: VOTER ID GENERATOR (FLASK)
🎯 Purpose

Generate unique, anonymous Voting IDs for eligible students before election day.

📥 Admin Input Form

Student Name

Class (8 or 9)

Section

Roll Number

⚙️ Backend Logic

Generate a random, non-guessable Voting ID

Ensure uniqueness

Store data in Google Sheets using Google Sheets API

📄 Google Sheet: VOTERS
VotingID | Class | Section | RollNo | Used


Used default = NO

Ability to lock generation after completion

Admin authentication required

🧩 APP 2: DIGITAL VOTING SYSTEM (FLASK)
🔑 VOTER VERIFICATION

Student enters Voting ID

Backend checks:

Voting ID exists

Used = NO

Belongs to Class 8 or 9

If invalid → show error

If valid → proceed to voting

🗳️ MULTI-POST VOTING FLOW

Students vote for multiple posts in one session.

Example posts:

Head Boy

Head Girl

Sports Captain

Cultural Secretary

Flow:

Show Post 1 → select candidate → Next

Show Post 2 → select candidate → Next

…

Final confirmation screen

Submit all votes together

Rules:

Cannot skip a post

Cannot go back after submit

Include NOTA option for each post

📄 Google Sheet: VOTES
VotingID | HeadBoy | HeadGirl | SportsCaptain | CulturalSecretary | Timestamp


After submission:

Mark Used = YES in VOTERS

Auto-reset UI for next student

🔐 SECURITY & CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

Implement:

Flask session-based admin authentication

One-time Voting ID usage

Admin panel for:

Start / Stop voting

Pause voting (emergency)

View results (hidden from students)

No student names stored with votes

Internet used only for Google Sheets sync

Clear separation between voter identity and votes

🌱 ECO-FRIENDLY EMPHASIS (IMPORTANT)

Include visible UI text such as:

“This election is paper-free 🌱”

“Digital voting for a greener campus”

“Zero paper ballots used”

Mention eco-impact in:

Homepage

Admin dashboard

Results page

🖥️ UI / UX REQUIREMENTS

Clean, minimal school-appropriate design

Large buttons and readable fonts

Step-by-step guided voting

Auto-reset after each voter

Green / blue color theme

No distractions

🧪 TESTING / MOCK MODE

Add a Mock Election Mode:

Uses a separate Google Sheet

Allows trial runs

Can be reset instantly

Disabled during real election

🧑‍🏫 ADMIN / RESULTS PANEL

Features:

Secure admin login

Generate instant results

Bar / pie charts per post

Export results (CSV / PDF)

Delete election data after declaration

🚀 DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (RENDER)

Flask app compatible with Render

requirements.txt

gunicorn setup

Environment variables for:

Google credentials

Admin password

Clear instructions for deployment on Render

🏁 FINAL GOAL

Deliver a Flask-based, Google Sheets-powered, eco-friendly digital election system
that:

Replaces paper ballots

Ensures fairness and transparency

Is fully controlled by teachers

Demonstrates responsible student innovation

🔥 END PROMPT
