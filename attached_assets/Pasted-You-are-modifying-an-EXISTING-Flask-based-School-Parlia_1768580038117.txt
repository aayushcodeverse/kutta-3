You are modifying an EXISTING Flask-based School Parliament Election System.

DO NOT add any database.
DO NOT change existing voting logic, candidate logic, Google Sheets integration, or admin authentication.
This is an ADD-ON MODULE only.

TASK:
Implement FULL voting-session camera recording with explicit user consent.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Consent Screen
- Before camera access, show a mandatory consent page.
- Include checkbox text:
  “I consent to this voting session being recorded for anti-impersonation purposes.
   The recording is not linked to my vote and will be deleted within 24 hours.”
- Disable “Continue” until checkbox is checked.

2. Camera & Recording (Frontend Only)
- Use browser-native APIs only (getUserMedia + MediaRecorder).
- Record video (camera + microphone) for the entire voting session.
- Show a visible recording indicator (red dot + ‘Recording’ text).
- Start recording immediately after consent.
- Stop recording automatically when vote submission succeeds.

3. Upload Logic
- After stopping, upload the video file to Flask using FormData.
- Do NOT upload during recording.
- Upload only once after vote is completed.

4. File Storage (NO DATABASE)
- Store videos as files only (filesystem storage).
- Create a secure folder named:
  /secure_sessions
- Folder must NOT be publicly accessible or inside /static.

5. File Naming Convention
- Save video as:
  VOTESESSION_{CLASS}{SECTION}_{ROLL}_{TIMESTAMP}.webm
- Timestamp format: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- Do NOT include vote choices or candidate names anywhere.

6. Backend Upload Route
- Create a Flask POST endpoint: /upload_session_video
- Accept video file securely.
- Save file to /secure_sessions.
- Return JSON success response.

7. Auto-Delete Rule (MANDATORY)
- Implement automatic deletion of video files older than 24 hours.
- Use filesystem timestamps (NO DATABASE).
- Run cleanup:
  - On every video upload
  - OR on admin login

8. Logging (Optional, lightweight)
- Log ONLY:
  Voting ID, timestamp, “Video Saved = YES”
- No vote data
- No face recognition
- No biometric analysis

9. Security Constraints
- No face recognition
- No image extraction
- No public access URLs
- No third-party libraries
- No external storage services

10. UX Rules
- Clear privacy messaging
- No technical jargon for students
- Fail safely if camera permission is denied

OUTPUT EXPECTED:
- Minimal JS code for MediaRecorder
- Flask upload endpoint
- Filesystem cleanup function
- Clean integration with existing app flow
