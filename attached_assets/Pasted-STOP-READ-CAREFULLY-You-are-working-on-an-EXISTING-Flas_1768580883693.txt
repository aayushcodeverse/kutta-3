STOP. READ CAREFULLY.

You are working on an EXISTING Flask-based School Parliament Election System
that is ALREADY CONNECTED to a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- DO NOT ask to upgrade anything.
- DO NOT switch to autonomous mode.
- DO NOT add any database.
- DO NOT create a new Google Sheet.
- DO NOT create new tabs unless the project already uses one for students.
- DO NOT modify existing authentication, voting logic, or admin logic.
- Use the EXISTING Google Sheets connection and credentials ONLY.

TASK:
Create and RUN a one-time Python script that writes student records
DIRECTLY into the ALREADY CONNECTED Google Sheet.

STUDENT GENERATION SPECIFICATIONS:

1. Classes:
- 8
- 9

2. Divisions / Sections:
- A
- B
- C
- D

3. Roll Numbers:
- 1 to 62 (inclusive) for EACH division of EACH class

4. For EACH student, write ONE ROW with the FOLLOWING FIELDS
(in the SAME COLUMN ORDER already used by the project):

- Class
- Section
- Roll Number
- Student Name (placeholder, e.g. STUDENT_8A_01)
- Voting ID (generated using the EXISTING ID generation logic)
- Voting Status = NOT_VOTED

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT invent a new schema.
- Match the EXACT column structure already used in the Google Sheet.

5. Duplicate Safety:
- Before writing, check the Google Sheet.
- If a student with the same Class + Section + Roll Number exists,
  DO NOT insert a duplicate.
- Skip existing entries silently.

6. Execution Requirements:
- This script must RUN immediately and populate the sheet.
- Print:
  - Total students attempted
  - Total students successfully inserted
  - Total duplicates skipped

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Students for Class 8 and 9, Sections A–D, Roll 1–62
  are written into the EXISTING Google Sheet.

DO NOT:
- Ask any clarification questions
- Suggest improvements
- Modify other files
- Add features

JUST IMPLEMENT AND RUN THIS SCRIPT USING THE EXISTING GOOGLE SHEETS CONNECTION.
